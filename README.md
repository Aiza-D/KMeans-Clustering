<h3>KMeans Clustering</h3>

Follow steps have been followed: <br>
<ol>
<li>Loading the Country-data.csv dataset. </li>
<li>Dropping any non-numeric columns from the dataset. </li>
<li>Plotting nine different scatter plots with different combinations of variables against GDPP and child_mort. For example, GDPP vs health. </li>
  <ul>
  <li>Note which of these plots looks the most promising for separating into clusters.</li>
  </ul>
<li>Normalising the dataset using MinMaxScaler from sklearn. </li>
<li>Finding the optimal number of clusters using the elbow and silhouette score method. </li>
<li>Fitting the scaled dataset to the optimal number of clusters. Reporting back on the silhouette score of the model. </li>
<li>Visualising the clusters for the following two groups:  </li>
     <ul>
  	<li>Child mortality vs GDPP</li> 
  	<li>Inﬂation vs GDP</li>
     </ul>
<li>Labeling the groups of countries in the plots created based on child mortality, GDPP, and inﬂation using terms such as: </li>
  <ul>least developed, developing, and developed.</ul>
</ul>

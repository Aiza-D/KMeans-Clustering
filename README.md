Follow steps have been followed:

●	Loading the Country-data.csv dataset.
●	Dropping any non-numeric columns from the dataset.
●	Plotting nine different scatter plots with different combinations of variables against GDPP and child_mort. For example, GDPP vs health.
○	Note which of these plots looks the most promising for separating into clusters.
●	Normalising the dataset using MinMaxScaler from sklearn.
●	Finding the optimal number of clusters using the elbow and silhouette score method.
●	Fitting the scaled dataset to the optimal number of clusters. Reporting back on the silhouette score of the model.
●	Visualising the clusters for the following two groups:
○	Child mortality vs GDPP
○	Inﬂation vs GDPP
●	Labeling the groups of countries in the plots created based on child mortality, GDPP, and inﬂation using terms such as: least developed, developing, and developed.
